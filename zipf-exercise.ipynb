    "We are going to be doing the same computations to visualize the applicability of Zipf's law to a range of data sets, so we create a class Zipf to organize this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic way to visualize Zipf's law is with a scatter plot on a log-log scale. Each item is plotted as a dot at a position  (x,y)(x,y) , where  xx  is its rank (from most common to least common) and  yy  is its actual frequency. Mathematically, you can tell that the data on this kind of scatter plot will all lie on a monotonically decreasing curve: by definition lower ranked entities are more common. However, Zipf's law is reflected in the fact that the curve for linguistic data tends to have a particular shape. In fact, the bulk of the data falls on a line. We'll explain this through examples below. The graph method of a Zipf object displays this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bunch of other code snippets can be used to help explore a Zipf object z:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `z.singletons()` a generator function that lists items that occur once in the data set\n",
    "- `z.n_items_with_rate(k)` count the number of items in the data set that occur k times\n",
    "- `z.rates.most_common(k)` get a list of the k most common items in the data set\n",
    "- `z.corr` a matrix giving the correlation coefficient of ranks against log frequencies, typically showing that rank predicts a very large amount of the variance in log frequency.\n",
    "- `z.describe_singletons()` gives a summary of the frequency of rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `Zipf` object, pass in two arguments: `name` (for labeling graphs), and `rates` (a counter, dictionary or similar structure that associates items with numeric values). The initialization uses the `rankdata` function of scipy to order the items (and reverses the ranks since rankdata goes from lowest to highest), and computes the correlation coefficient. It stores all the results of its computations for later inspection."
